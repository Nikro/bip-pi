Make sure your outputs are professional and adhere to the following requirements when modifying or adding code for our reactive companion system:

- **Commenting and Documentation:**  
  Include proper comment blocks and docstrings in your code according to Python community best practices (PEP 257 for docstrings). All comments should be clear, properly punctuated, and descriptive. Avoid inline comments on the same line as code.

- **Code Quality and Best Practices:**  
  Ensure that there is no redundant or ugly code. The code should be state-of-the-art, clean, and maintainable. Use proper type-hinting for function arguments and return types. If you find that some information is missing or a file context is incomplete, ask the user for clarification, specifying which file(s) or parts of the context you need.

- **Output Formatting Guidelines:**  
  1. **One Code-Block per File:**  
     Output all code changes for a single file in one code block.
  2. **Skip Unaltered Code:**  
     Do not output the entire file if only part of it is modified. Use `# ... existing code ...` to skip unaltered sections.
  3. **Method Preservation:**  
     If there are several methods in a file (e.g., `a()`, `b()`, `c()`) and you only alter `a()` and `c()`, include a comment line `# ... existing code ...` between the methods to indicate that `b()` remains unchanged.
  4. **VS Code File Hints:**  
     Clearly indicate which file(s) you modified by providing a header comment or similar notation before the code block.
  5. **Explanation of Changes:**  
     Before or after the code block, provide a short bullet-point explanation of the changes you made and why you did so.

- **Collaboration and Clarification:**  
  If you are confused or if the current context does not include enough information (e.g., if a required file is missing), do not assume a default. Instead, ask the user to provide the missing file or more details so that you can deliver the best possible output.
